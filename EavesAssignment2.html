    Final Project Proposal<br>

	<p>My proposal for my final project is an interactive GUI. I will have three drawings attached to this proposal that I will refer to <em>Fig.1</em>, <em>Fig.2</em> and <em>Fig.3.</em> The overall idea is to create a Dungeons & Dragons game board and dice roll visualizer. The idea came to me the last time I played. I thought “It would be neat to have some kind of app or program to track movement and dice rolls as opposed to having to draw the world out on a gridded white board every time”. If you refer to <em>Fig.1</em>, upon the launch of the program, it will load a window with a gridded game world. In the number 1 section of <em>Fig.1</em>, there will be radio button options to change the background environment. In section 2 of <em>Fig.1</em>, there will be tokens or icons that you can click and drag to snap on one of the grid squares. These icons will be labeled for players, enemies and non-playable characters. Section 3 of <em>Fig.1</em> is an “Encounter” button. The idea for this button is that I will implement some kind of listener for the draggable icons. That way the program knows what grid the player icon is on. Once the “Encounter” button is pressed, the program will display a blown-up view of the current grid square (see <em>Fig.2</em>). And finally, for <em>Fig.1</em>, is section 4. Section 4 will display <em>Fig.3</em>. I will explain <em>Fig.3</em> later on in the proposal.</p>
	<p><em>Fig.2</em> is very similar to <em>Fig.1</em> in that it will be an art asset with a grid layout. Really the only thing you can do in this window is move the icons around (no listener necessary). This window will have similar icons to <em>Fig.1</em>, with the player, enemies and NPC’s. Section 2 of <em>Fig.2</em> is the “Over World” button. This button will change the window back to <em>Fig.1</em>. Section 3, like section 4 of <em>Fig.1</em>, will take you to a new window (<em>Fig.3</em>).</p>
	<p><em>Fig.3</em> will be a dice visualizer. This window will consist of buttons in the bottom left hand corner labeled D4, D6, D10, D12, and D20 for their respective die. Upon clicking any one of these buttons, it will generate a random die roll for the respective die, as well as displaying the result in the window with the appropriate art asset for the die. It is not in the figure, but I would also like to try and put in the top right corner, the last five die roll results. The icon section of this window will be left blank as will the “Over World” and “Encounter” buttons. There will be a button on the bottom right, where the Dice Roll button was that upon clicking will take you back to the last window you were in.</p>
