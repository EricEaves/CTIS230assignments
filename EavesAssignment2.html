        Final Project Proposal<br></h2>

    <div id="pg1paragraph">
        <p class="intro">My proposal for my final project is an interactive GUI. I will have three drawings attached to
            this
            proposal that I will refer to <em>Fig.1</em>, <em>Fig.2</em> and <em>Fig.3.</em>
            The overall idea is to create a Dungeons & Dragons game board and dice roll visualizer. The idea came to me
            the
            last time I played.
            I thought “It would be neat to have some kind of app or program to track movement and dice rolls as opposed
            to
            having to draw the world out on a gridded white board every time”.
            If you refer to <em>Fig.1</em>, upon the launch of the program, it will load a window with a gridded game
            world.
            In the number 1 section of <em>Fig.1</em>, there will be radio button options to change the background
            environment.
            In section 2 of <em>Fig.1</em>, there will be tokens or icons that you can click and drag to snap on one of
            the
            grid squares. These icons will be labeled for players, enemies and non-playable characters.
            Section 3 of <em>Fig.1</em> is an “Encounter” button. The idea for this button is that I will implement some
            kind of listener for the draggable icons.
            That way the program knows what grid the player icon is on. Once the “Encounter” button is pressed, the
            program
            will display a blown-up view of the current grid square (see <em>Fig.2</em>).
            And finally, for <em>Fig.1</em>, is section 4. Section 4 will display <em>Fig.3</em>. I will explain
            <em>Fig.3</em> later on in the proposal.</p>
