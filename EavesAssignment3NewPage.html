        <h1>Eric Eaves Assignment 3</h1>
        <p><em>Fig.2</em> is very similar to <em>Fig.1</em> in that it will be an art asset with a grid layout.
             Really the only thing you can do in this window is move the icons around (no listener necessary).
              This window will have similar icons to <em>Fig.1</em>, with the player, enemies and NPC’s. Section 2 of <em>Fig.2</em> is the “Over World” button. 
              This button will change the window back to <em>Fig.1</em>. Section 3, like section 4 of <em>Fig.1</em>, will take you to a new window (<em>Fig.3</em>).</p>
