        <p><em>Fig.2</em> is very similar to <em>Fig.1</em> in that it will be an art asset with a grid layout.
             Really the only thing you can do in this window is move the icons around (no listener necessary).
              This window will have similar icons to <em>Fig.1</em>, with the player, enemies and NPC’s. Section 2 of <em>Fig.2</em> is the “Over World” button. 
              This button will change the window back to <em>Fig.1</em>. Section 3, like section 4 of <em>Fig.1</em>, will take you to a new window (<em>Fig.3</em>).</p>
    <p><em>Fig.3</em> will be a dice visualizer. This window will consist of buttons in the bottom left hand corner labeled D4, D6, D10, D12, and D20 for their respective die. 
        Upon clicking any one of these buttons, it will generate a random die roll for the respective die, as well as displaying the result in the window with the appropriate art asset for the die.
         It is not in the figure, but I would also like to try and put in the top right corner, the last five die roll results. 
         The icon section of this window will be left blank as will the “Over World” and “Encounter” buttons. 
         There will be a button on the bottom right, where the Dice Roll button was that upon clicking will take you back to the last window you were in.</p>
